## The Quantum Freeze
Safely navigate your penguin across a frozen lake avoiding the hidden holes! You can make classical moves from one square to the next but you can also make a quantum move - splitting your penguin into a superposition of states. Explore how quantum superposition can help solve the levels whilst constructing a circuit to run on Rigettiâ€™s quantum computer.

## Riverlane
Based in Cambridge, UK, Riverlane (https://riverlane.io) is developing a Simulation Engine for microscopic systems. Leveraging quantum computers to accurately account for quantum effects, the Riverlane Simulation Engine will will bring the discovery of materials and drugs into a new computational era - one where the physical laboratory is used only sparingly to validate results, fundamentally accelerating the pace of discovery.

## Installation

1. Install Rigetti's QVM and quilc compiler. You will recieve the link to download both programs when you sign up for QCS.
2. Pull this repository, install the requirements.txt, and run with `./QuantumFreeze`.
5. Enjoy!
