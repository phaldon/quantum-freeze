## The Quantum Freeze
Safely navigate your penguin across a frozen lake avoiding the hidden holes! You can make classical moves from one square to the next but you can also make a quantum move - splitting your penguin into a superposition of states. Explore how quantum superposition can help solve the levels whilst constructing a circuit to run on Rigettiâ€™s quantum computer.


## Installation

1. Install Rigetti's QVM and quilc compiler. You will recieve the link to download both programs when you sign up for QCS.
2. Pull this repository, install the requirements.txt, and run with `./quantum-freeze.py`.
5. Enjoy!


## Contributors
The Quantum Freeze was developed by Sam Coward and Tom Parks with numerous suggestions for levels from the rest of the Riverlane team!
